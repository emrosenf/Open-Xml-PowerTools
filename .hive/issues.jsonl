Exact functional equivalence to C# implementation\n2. No algorithm changes, no heuristics\n3. Translation-first: Port C# line-by-line\n4. Tests validate, not guide (run only after implementation)\n5. Naming convention: Rust functions mirror C# method names\n\nSource: RUST_MIGRATION_PLAN_SYNTHESIS.md","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-26T15:18:58.594Z","updated_at":"2025-12-26T15:18:58.594Z","dependencies":[],"labels":[],"comments":[]}
